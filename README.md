-Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Driverpass is a company that wanted to expand its market by creating a website for online courses and scheduling driving appointments from one of its many drivers.

-What did you do particularly well?

I did particularly well presenting for a non-technical audience and keeping the project simple for anyone to understand.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the System Design document to improve my UML graphs.

-How did you interpret and implement the user's needs into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

Using the driver pass interview, I examined the company's needs closely and imagined myself as a site user. This has helped me consider the system's design and all the necessary requirements.

-How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Learning about functional and nonfunctional requirements and the different UML diagrams helped me further analyze a system. I will definitely keep these techniques in mind for future projects.
